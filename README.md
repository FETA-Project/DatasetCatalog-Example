# DatasetCatalog-Example
Getting started example with the Dataset Catalog report demonstrated on sampled dataset CESNET-MINER22. This repositori is divaded in two examples:
* CESNET-MINER22: represents the original dataset that provides raw captured data with annotation.
* CESNET-MINER22-PPI: represents derived dataset that cotains PPI data insted of raw captured data.

Both folders have the following structure:
* input: contains all input files for the dataset report
* output: contains all output files for the dataset report from dataset analysis
* example: contains configuration and support files for creation of the dataset report using [DatasetCatalog-Tools](https://github.com/FETA-Project/DatasetCatalog-Tools)

Both datasets are processed towards the dataset report. You can check generated results or re-run the evaluation.

# Getting Started Instructions
1. Download this repository. It provides all sample files for the Getting Started showcase
2. Download the [DatasetCatalog-Tools](https://github.com/FETA-Project/DatasetCatalog-Tools) repository. It contains all the dataset quality evaluation tools to get inputs for the dataset report.
3. Follow the Getting Started instructions below.

## CESNET-MINER22
This folder represents the original dataset that provides raw captured data with annotation. To process this dataset we can use NDVM and LLM Analyzer from [DatasetCatalog-Tools](https://github.com/FETA-Project/DatasetCatalog-Tools).
